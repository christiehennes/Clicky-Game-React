# National Park Clicky Game

[Project Link](https://christiehennes.github.io/Clicky-Game-React/)

## Instructions
 
 * Try to click the tiles as many times as you can without repeating a tile
 * Each time you click on a tile you already clicked on, your score will reset to zero
 * Try to get to as many points as you can! 


 ## Project Design

 * I used react to build this app. Each object in game uses its own component.
 * A json file is used to populate the content of the game. 
 * State is used ot keep track of which items have already been clicked and what the current score is.
